```
## Overview

### 1. LuckyDraw

The `LuckyDraw` class allows for winner selection based on item chances and weighted amounts.

#### Input Data

```php
$products = [
    [
        'item' => 'product_000_NoLuck', // Item code or Identifier
        'chances' => '100000',          // Item Chances
        'amounts'=> [ 1 ]              // Item Amounts
    ],
    [
        'item' => 'product_001',
        'chances' => '1000',
        'amounts' => '1.5,10.00001,1'    // Weighted CSV formatted range (min,max,bias)
    ],
    [
        'item' => 'product_002',
        'chances' => '500.001',         // Fraction Allowed
        'amounts' => [
            1 => 100,                   // Amount chances
            5 => 50,                    // Format: Amount => Chances
            10 => 10.002,               // Fraction allowed
        ]
    ],
    [
        'item' => 'product_003',
        'chances' => '100',
        'amounts' => [
            1 => 100,
            5 => 50,
            10 => 10,
            20 => 5, 
        ]
    ],
    [
        'item' => 'product_004',
        'chances' => '1',
        'amounts' => [ 10, 15, 30, 50 ] // Amounts without probability
    ],
]
```

- **item**: Provide your item's unique identifier

- **chances**: Weight of item (Float/Int).
    - It will be compared along all the items in array. 
    - The higher the chances the greater the chances of getting the item.
    - In case of active inventory you can pass available item stock here
    
- **amounts**: String or Array of Item amount (Float/Int). It can be any like:
    - (array) Single Positive value, i.e. [ 1 ] or Multiple Positive value (randomly picked), i.e. [ 1, 2, 3, 5]
    - (array) Weighted amount, i.e.    
        ```php
        [
            5 => 100,
            15 => 50,
            50 => 10,
            80 => 5.001
        ]
        ```
    - (String) Weighted CSV formatted range (min,max,bias) ```'1,10.00001,0.001'```
      - Only 3 members allowed in CSV format **min,max,bias**
      - Max should be greater than or equal to min, bias should be greater than 0
      - The higher the bias, the more the chance to pick the lowest amount

#### Usage

```php
$luckyDraw = new AbmmHasan\Draw\LuckyDraw($products);
$result = $luckyDraw->pick();
```

Example Output:

```php
[
    'item' => 'product_000_NoLuck',
    'amount' => 1
]
```

> Inventory Solutions: Available stock should be passed (after subtracting used amount from stock amount) in chances properly.

### 2. GrandDraw

The `GrandDraw` class is designed for large draws where items and user entries are managed in bulk.

#### Input Data

```php
$prizes = 
[
    'product_001'=>50,        // Item Code/Identifier => Amount of the item
    'product_002'=>5,
    'product_003'=>3,
    'product_004'=>2,
    'product_005'=>1
];
```

- **item**: Provide your item's unique identifier

- **amounts**: Amount of gift. It must be a positive integer value.

User entries are loaded using a CSV file:

```csv
"usr47671",
"usr57665",
"usr47671",
.....
```

#### Usage

```php
$grandDraw = new AbmmHasan\Draw\GrandDraw();
$grandDraw->setItems($prizes)
          ->setUserListFilePath('./Sample1000.csv');
$winners = $grandDraw->getWinners();
```

Example Output:

```php
[
    'product_001' => ['usr47671', 'usr57665', 'usr92400'],
    'product_002' => ['usr50344', 'usr60450', 'usr62662']
]
```

### 3. FlexibleDraw

The `FlexibleDraw` class offers a versatile approach to draws, supporting various types of selection methods, including probability-based, elimination, round-robin, and more. This flexibility allows for customized and dynamic but basic draws.

#### Supported Draw Types
- **Probability Draw**: Selects items based on their assigned probability weights.
- **Elimination Draw**: Items are drawn and removed from the selection pool, preventing repeated selection.
- **Round Robin Draw**: Items are selected in a round-robin sequence, ensuring each item is chosen before repeating.
- **Cumulative Draw**: Draws items based on cumulative weights, adjusting probabilities over time.
- **Batched Draw**: Draws a specified batch of items, with or without replacement.
- **Time-Based Draw**: Selects items based on time intervals or frequency criteria.
- **Weighted Batch Draw**: Draws a batch of items based on weighted probabilities.
- **Group Draw**: Selects items from within specific groups.
- **Sequential Draw**: Draws items in a predefined sequential order.
- **Range Weighted Draw**: Selects items based on a specified range with a weighted probability.

#### FlexibleDraw Options

1. **Probability Draw**:
    - Selects items based on weighted probabilities, allowing higher-weight items to be more likely chosen.

   ```php
   $items = [
       ['name' => 'item1', 'weight' => 10],
       ['name' => 'item2', 'weight' => 20],
   ];
   ```

2. **Weighted Elimination Draw**:
    - Items are selected and removed from the pool, ensuring each item is chosen only once.

   ```php
   $items = [
       ['name' => 'item1', 'weight' => 10],
       ['name' => 'item2', 'weight' => 20],
   ];

3. **Elimination Draw**:
    - Items are selected and removed from the pool, ensuring each item is chosen only once.

   ```php
   $items = [
       ['name' => 'item1'],
       ['name' => 'item2'],
   ];
   ```

4. **Round Robin Draw**:
    - Items are selected sequentially in a round-robin pattern.

   ```php
   $items = [
       ['name' => 'item1'],
       ['name' => 'item2'],
   ];
   ```

5. **Cumulative Draw**:
    - Draws items based on cumulative weights, with probabilities adjusting dynamically.

   ```php
   $items = [
       ['name' => 'item1'],
       ['name' => 'item2'],
   ];
   ```

6. **Batched Draw**:
    - Draws a batch of items in one call, with options for replacement. If replacement is enabled, same items will/can be drawn multiple times.

   ```php
   $items = [
       ['name' => 'item1'],
       ['name' => 'item2'],
   ];
   ```

7. **Time-Based Draw**:
    - Draws items based on specified time intervals or conditions.

   ```php
   $items = [
       ['name' => 'item1', 'weight' => 10, 'time' => 'daily'],
       ['name' => 'item2', 'weight' => 20, 'time' => 'weekly'],
   ];
   ```

8. **Weighted Batch Draw**:
    - Draws a batch of items using weighted probabilities, balancing selection based on item weights.

   ```php
   $items = [
       ['name' => 'item1', 'weight' => 10],
       ['name' => 'item2', 'weight' => 20],
   ];
   ```

9. **Sequential Draw**:
    - Selects items in a fixed, sequential order, ideal for draws that require strict ordering.

   ```php
   $items = [
       ['name' => 'item1'],
       ['name' => 'item2'],
   ];
   ```

10. **Range Weighted Draw**:
- Specifies a range for each item using `min`, `max`, and `weight` values.
- Ensures `min` is less than `max` for valid selection.

```php
$items = [
    ['name' => 'item1', 'min' => 1, 'max' => 50, 'weight' => 10],
    ['name' => 'item2', 'min' => 5, 'max' => 25, 'weight' => 15],
];
```

#### Usage

```php
$flexibleDraw = new AbmmHasan\Draw\FlexibleDraw($items);
$result = $flexibleDraw->draw();
```

### Example Output

Based on the selected draw type, the output will provide details on the chosen item, including any range, group, or other specifications:

```php
[
    'item' => 'item1',
    'weight' => 10,
    'group' => 'groupA'
]
```

### FlexibleDraw Configuration Summary

The `FlexibleDraw` class can adapt to various selection methods, supporting custom configurations with properties like `weight`, `group`, `min`, `max`, and more. This class is ideal for applications that require nuanced, dynamic draw methods beyond basic random selection but not complex as Lucky Draw or high volume as Grand Draw.
